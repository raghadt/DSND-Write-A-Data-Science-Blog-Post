## Introduction:
A project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

This project applies the process CRISP-DM: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
which consist of 6 phases:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Prepare Data
4. Data Modeling
5. Evaluate the Results
6. Deploy.

## Installation/Tools:

* Python 3.6
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
* Jupyterlab (Jupyter notebook is ok too).

The data used for this project is from Kaggle, Top Spotify Tracks of 2018 (https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018/data#)


## Motivation:
This is a project for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. In this project, we're supposed to look at a dataset of our choice, and apply the 6 steps of CRISP-DM.
Personally, I chose a dataset from Spotify.
Spotify is one of the top music apps used world-wide. I think it would be very to understand more about what the world likes in terms of music.

I have 4 questions in mind that I would like to know the answer for:
Q1: Who are the artists with major tracks.
Q2: Who are the top 10 artists.
Q3: what’s the Artists distribubtion. Is there a relationship between artists and speechiness
Q4: what’s the relationship between loudness and energy?
